## Main Objectives

- Minimize weekly beverage production costs subject to composition and demand constraints using linear programming methods.
- Maximize profit in a multi-product, multi-season textile operation by allocating raw material resources under proportional and demand constraints.
- Analyze a two-person sequential game with no pure-strategy equilibrium, and determine optimal mixed strategies through payoff matrix construction and linear programming.

## Key Results

- Formulated beverage mix LP model; found the cost-minimizing blend is 105L of product A and 35L of product B, with an optimal cost of $840/week, and derived sensitivity ranges for cost stability.
- Developed and solved a profit maximization LP for textile manufacturing; identified optimal material allocations and achieved a maximum profit of $203,620 through explicit calculation of decision variables.
- Built a payoff matrix for a competitive game, showed the existence of infinite mixed strategy solutions, and computed optimal play probabilities for both players leveraging LP duality.
- All solution strategies and feasible regions illustrated by graphical and algebraic methods; R used for computational efficiency and reproducibility.
