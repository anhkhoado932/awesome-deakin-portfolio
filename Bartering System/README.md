## Main Objectives

- Enable users to barter and exchange used items in an efficient, secure, and user-friendly online platform.
- Facilitate streamlined transactions including listing, negotiation, messaging, and post-transaction review, with easy admin oversight and moderation.
- Build a scalable, maintainable, and testable web application for practical trading scenarios, using modern web technologies.

## Key Results

- Comprehensive user features: account registration/login, product listing, favorites, filtering, transaction initiation, and real-time chat.
- Robust transaction workflow: status tracking (active, pending, finished, interrupted), in-app messaging via Socket.io.
- Effective post-trade feedback system and admin control (edit, delete, manage users/products/feedback).
- Docker integration for easy deployment; automated tests for reliability and maintainability.
- Positive user experience validated through intuitive UI/UX and successful item exchange flow.
