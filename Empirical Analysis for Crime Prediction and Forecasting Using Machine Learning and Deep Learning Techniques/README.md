## Main Objectives

- Reproduce the paper [Empirical Analysis for Crime Prediction and Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9424589/) using the following classification methods: Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and XGBoost. This reproduction must use the exact features, parameters, and training/testing splitting approaches as described in the original article.
- Design and develop a novel machine learning solution for crime prediction that differs substantially from the reproduced methods by modifying feature selection or using different ML methods or their combinations.
- Provide a detailed technical report including model descriptions, experimental protocols, evaluation metrics, results comparisons (with tables/graphs), discussion against published literature, and referencing.
## Key Results

- Random Forest and KNN achieved the highest precision (0.92 and 0.91) on TON_IoT dataset.
- SVM and MLP demonstrated the best weighted F1-scores (0.73) on NSL-KDD dataset.
- Logistic Regression showed lower recall and F1-scores comparatively, especially on TON_IoT.
- Hyperparameter tuning significantly enhanced model reliability and enabled robust network intrusion detection.
