# My Awesome Portfolio 🎓
Awesome projects I worked on at Deakin, and what I learned. Software, Data & AI, Cloud Computing.

## SIT725: Applied Software Engineering
### [Bartering System](./Bartering%20System/)
This project delivers a full-stack bartering platform enabling users to trade used goods, supporting user registration, item listing, real-time chat, and transactional feedback. It implements comprehensive features—product upload, favorites, barter negotiation, admin management, and secure transactions—achieving robust usability and multi-user support. The system is developed using JavaScript, Node.js, Express, EJS, Socket.io, Docker, HTML, and CSS.

## SIT788: Engineering AI Solution
### [Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate AI-102](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/khoado-9821/credentials/651931095317d65f)
Prove the ability to design, deploy, and orchestrate enterprise-grade Azure AI solutions including generative AI, agentic architectures, computer vision, NLP, and information extraction.
### [Fashion recommendation system using Azure AI]()

## SIT727: Cloud Automation Technologies
### [Deploying a Highly Available Wordpress Application](./Deploying%20a%20Highly%20Available%20Wordpress%20Application/)
This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment and optimization of a highly available WordPress application using AWS, focusing on solution architecture for scalability, performance, and business continuity. The implementation spans core AWS services: VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, ALB, Auto Scaling Groups, and CloudFormation.

Improve for high availability by leveraging Fargate, Aurora Serverless, ElastiCache, Route 53, and CloudFront to meet advanced business requirements like disaster recovery, global low-latency, encryption, and cost efficiency. 


## SIT720: Machine Learning
### [Empirical Analysis for Crime Prediction and Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques](./Empirical%20Analysis%20for%20Crime%20Prediction%20and%20Forecasting%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20Techniques/)
This project implements and tunes several machine learning algorithms for crime prediction and forcasting, aiming to improve intrusion detection system accuracy. It applies extensive hyperparameter optimization via RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV on KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and MLP models, achieving strong detection metrics on both datasets. 


## SIT744: Deep Learning

### [Are Neurons Actually Collapsed? On the Fine-Grained Structure in Neural Representations](./Are%20Neurons%20Actually%20Collapsed?%20On%20the%20Fine-Grained%20Structure%20in%20Neural%20Representations/)
This project replicates the findings from “Are Neurons Actually Collapsed?”, demonstrating that neural network representations—while exhibiting Neural Collapse (the tendency for last-layer activations to group by class)—retain a rich, fine-grained structure influenced by the input distribution. The replication confirms that these subtle structures persist even after perfect classification, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and practical neural network behaviors. All experiments are reproduced using Tensorflow with custom data pipelines and visualization tools.


## SIT719: Data Analytics for Security
### [End-to-end project delivery on cyber-security data analytics](./End-to-end%20project%20delivery%20on%20cyber-security%20data%20analytics/)
The main objective of this project is to build effective cyber-attack classification models on network traffic data to protect critical digital infrastructure. With the continuous rise in cyber threats such as Denial-of-Service (DoS), unauthorized access, and data breaches, accurately detecting malicious activities is vital for maintaining network security and preventing substantial operational and financial damage. 


### [The impact of adversarial machine learning in security and privacy analytics: A survey](./The%20impact%20of%20adversarial%20machine%20learning%20in%20security%20and%20privacy%20analytics:%20A%20survey/)
This project surveys the impact of adversarial machine learning on security and privacy analytics, emphasizing vulnerabilities from training data poisoning to evasion attacks on deployed models. It reviews state-of-the-art attack techniques, defense strategies, and tools used for enhancing robustness in real-world machine learning systems, including a practical case study on Facebook's spam detection pipeline.
