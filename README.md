# My Awesome Portfolio
High Distinction projects I worked on at Deakin, and what I learned. Some software, some Data & AI, and some cloud computing.

### [End-to-end project delivery on cyber-security data analytics](./End-to-end%20project%20delivery%20on%20cyber-security%20data%20analytics/)
The main objective of this project is to build effective cyber-attack classification models on network traffic data to protect critical digital infrastructure. With the continuous rise in cyber threats such as Denial-of-Service (DoS), unauthorized access, and data breaches, accurately detecting malicious activities is vital for maintaining network security and preventing substantial operational and financial damage. 


### [The impact of adversarial machine learning in security and privacy analytics: A survey](./The%20impact%20of%20adversarial%20machine%20learning%20in%20security%20and%20privacy%20analytics:%20A%20survey/)
This project surveys the impact of adversarial machine learning on security and privacy analytics, emphasizing vulnerabilities from training data poisoning to evasion attacks on deployed models. It reviews state-of-the-art attack techniques, defense strategies, and tools used for enhancing robustness in real-world machine learning systems, including a practical case study on Facebook's spam detection pipeline.
