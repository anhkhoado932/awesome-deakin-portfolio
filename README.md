# My Awesome Portfolio
High Distinction projects I worked on at Deakin, and what I learned. Some software, some Data & AI, and some cloud computing.
## SIT720: Machine Learning
### [Empirical Analysis for Crime Prediction and Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques](./Empirical%20Analysis%20for%20Crime%20Prediction%20and%20Forecasting%20Using%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Deep%20Learning%20Techniques/)
This project implements and tunes several machine learning algorithms for crime prediction and forcastic, aiming to improve intrusion detection system accuracy. It applies extensive hyperparameter optimization via RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV on KNN, Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and MLP models, achieving strong detection metrics on both datasets. 


## SIT719: Data Analytics for Security
### [End-to-end project delivery on cyber-security data analytics](./End-to-end%20project%20delivery%20on%20cyber-security%20data%20analytics/)
The main objective of this project is to build effective cyber-attack classification models on network traffic data to protect critical digital infrastructure. With the continuous rise in cyber threats such as Denial-of-Service (DoS), unauthorized access, and data breaches, accurately detecting malicious activities is vital for maintaining network security and preventing substantial operational and financial damage. 


### [The impact of adversarial machine learning in security and privacy analytics: A survey](./The%20impact%20of%20adversarial%20machine%20learning%20in%20security%20and%20privacy%20analytics:%20A%20survey/)
This project surveys the impact of adversarial machine learning on security and privacy analytics, emphasizing vulnerabilities from training data poisoning to evasion attacks on deployed models. It reviews state-of-the-art attack techniques, defense strategies, and tools used for enhancing robustness in real-world machine learning systems, including a practical case study on Facebook's spam detection pipeline.
